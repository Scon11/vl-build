# VL Pitch Redesign – Execution-First Output Structure

**Source of Truth:** `/home/sean/clawd/reference/vantage-sales-training.md`

**Design Principle:** If a rep reads something and still wonders "what should I do?", it failed.

|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 🥇 Primary | [Title] | [Decision authority + pain ownership] |

**Coaching Note:** [1-2 sentences on approach based on org structure]

---

### 3. 🗣️ Call-Ready Scripts
**Purpose:** Verbatim language reps can use immediately. No thinking required.

### 4. 🛡️ Live Objection Reframes
**Purpose:** Confidence on the call. Say this, not that.

#### "We already have a provider"
> **Say:** "Totally understand — most of our customers did too. We usually come in when performance issues or specialized lanes pop up. Would it be worth seeing if there's a gap we could help with?"
>
> **Tone:** Casual confidence. Not defensive. You're offering optionality, not begging.

#### "Not interested"
> **Say:** "I get it. Just curious — what's working well for you right now? If nothing else, I'd love to learn what a company like yours prioritizes."
>
> **Tone:** Curious, not pushy. Opens door to conversation.

#### "Send me an email"
> **Say:** "Happy to. Just so I'm not spamming you — what would actually make it worth opening?"
>
> **Tone:** Direct. Qualifies intent. If they can't answer, they're brushing you off.

#### "We're not onboarding new providers"
> **Say:** "That's fair. We play the long game anyway — this would just be a 15-minute intro so when timing's right, you know who to call. Would [DAY] work?"
>
> **Tone:** No pressure. Positions as relationship-building.

#### [PROSPECT-SPECIFIC OBJECTION]
> **Say:** [CUSTOM REFRAME BASED ON ANALYSIS]
>
> **Coaching:** [WHY THIS OBJECTION IS LIKELY FOR THIS PROSPECT]

## Example Output: Acme Steel Products

### 🎯 30-Second Summary
**Acme Steel Products** is a 200-employee steel fabrication company shipping finished steel components (beams, structural steel, rebar) via flatbed and step deck.

Pain signal: Website mentions "just-in-time delivery to job sites" — classic capacity crunch risk.

Fit: **8/10** — Strong flatbed need, pain signals present, mid-market sweet spot.

---

### 📞 Who to Call First

| Priority | Title/Role | Why This Person |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| 🥇 Primary | VP of Operations or Supply Chain Director | Owns logistics decisions, feels delivery pain directly |
| 🥈 Secondary | Plant Manager or Logistics Coordinator | Operational insight, can validate pain and champion internally |
| ⚠️ Avoid First | Purchasing / Procurement | Often gatekeeps without authority, focuses on price not value |

**Coaching Note:** Steel fabricators are operations-driven. The person who hears complaints from job sites is your buyer. Avoid procurement until you've built internal momentum.

---

### 🗣️ Call-Ready Scripts

#### Cold Call Power Statement
```
"Hi [NAME], this is [REP] with Vantage Logistics.

I work with steel fabricators who are frustrated by flatbed capacity disappearing right when they need it most — especially for job site deliveries with tight windows.

We help by building dedicated carrier capacity so you're not scrambling last-minute, which means fewer missed deliveries and less finger-pointing from GCs.

Would 15 minutes make sense to see if there's a fit?"
```

#### Voicemail Version
```
"Hi [NAME], [REP] with Vantage. 

I work with steel fabricators dealing with flatbed capacity crunches on job site deliveries. We've helped similar companies lock in reliable capacity so they're not scrambling.

Worth a quick call — I'll try you Thursday, or reach me at [NUMBER]."
```

#### Cold Email Opener
```
Subject: Flatbed headaches at Acme?

[NAME],

Saw you're delivering structural steel to job sites — guessing that means tight windows and GCs who don't accept excuses.

We work with fabricators who are tired of capacity disappearing when they need it most. We help by building dedicated flatbed capacity so you're not scrambling, which means fewer missed deliveries.

Would 15 minutes this week make sense?

### 🛡️ Live Objection Reframes

#### "We already have a provider"
> **Say:** "Totally understand — most of our steel customers did too. We usually come in when capacity gets tight or specialized lanes pop up. Would it be worth a quick look to see if there's a gap?"
>
> **Tone:** You're offering a backup, not replacing anyone.

#### "Our rates are locked in"
> **Say:** "Makes sense. Rate's one piece — what we usually find with fabricators is the pain is more about capacity when you need it. Is that ever an issue, or are you covered?"
>
> **Tone:** Shift from price to availability. Steel guys know capacity matters.

#### "We handle logistics in-house"
> **Say:** "Got it. A lot of our customers started that way. When dedicated lanes or overflow come up, that's usually where we fit in. Worth keeping us on the radar?"
>
> **Tone:** Position as supplement, not replacement.

### 📊 Fit Score Explained

**Score: 8/10**

| Factor | Rating | Notes |

| Pain Signal Strength | High | "Just-in-time delivery" on website = capacity pressure |

## Implementation Notes

1. **Update the GPT-4o prompt** in `/src/app/api/pitch/analyze/route.ts` to output this structure
2. **Update the UI** in `/src/app/pitch/[domain]/page.tsx` to render these sections
3. **Collapse Research Notes by default** — expandable for those who want it
4. **Add "Copy to Clipboard" buttons** on scripts for easy pasting
5. **Consider adding audio playback** for voicemail scripts (future)
